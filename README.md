## Quick Start

### Install
> **Note**: Before running our code, it's highly recommended to first play with [RSL's Legged Gym version](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym) to get a basic understanding of the Isaac-LeggedGym-RslRL framework.

Similar to basic legged-gym based codebase, the install pipeline is:
1. Create environment and install torch

   ```text
   conda create -n omnih2o python=3.8 
   pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio 
   ```

   

2. Install Isaac Gym preview 4 release https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym

   unzip files to a folder, then install with pip:

   `cd isaacgym/python && pip install -e .`

   check it is correctly installed by playing: 

   ```cmd
   cd examples && python 1080_balls_of_solitude.py
   ```

3. Clone our repo
    
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:LeCAR-Lab/wococo.git
    ```

4. install packages
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


### Training

- go to `legged_gym/legged_gym`

    ```
    python3 scripts/train.py --task=h1:jumpjack
    ```

### Play

- go to `legged_gym/legged_gym`
  
    ```
    python scripts/play.py --task=h1:jumpjack --num_envs=3
    ```

## Note

Since our framework is quite intuitive and we *de-engineered* a lot of things, (i.e., we do not use certain engineering tricks that can be applied to specific tasks such as terrain curriculum) to showcase the framework's capability, we provide a clap-and-dance example here for the reward and MDP implementations, and encourage anyone to engineer the specific environments for better performance on their own applications.

The engineering is encouraged for terrain design, curiosity observation space design (which can be further reduced based on specific tasks), and sim-to-real pipeline (where tricks like teacher-student and system identification may make training and deployment more stable).
